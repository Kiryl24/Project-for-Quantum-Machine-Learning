This project was aimed at getting to know better, how does quantum computers operate. Whole project is based on quiskit.
Developed aplication has two modes:
- first is to analize input frequency from microphone and determine average frequency, and compare it to closest piano key,
- second is to analize input sound from file and determine if it is a cat or a dog.
During tests it was shown, that it works just fine, ready to be upgraded.
